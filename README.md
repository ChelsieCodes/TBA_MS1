## Introduction

Welcome to my first project, part of the Code Institute Level 5 Diploma in Web Development Course. The purpose of this project is to build a responsive website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap only.

The Bark Academy is a project for a fictional dog training company specialising in socialisation and behavioural issues.

Users will be able to navigate through the website using a navigation bar. 
Users will be able to easily identify the purpose of the business on the home page.
Users are able to see a range of services offered, a gallery containing previous customers experiences and will be able to send enquiries to the business via a contact form on a dedicated page.

#### Thank you for visiting The Bark Academy

## UX - User Experience Design

A user experience designer, Jesse James Garrett, introduced five UX design elements in his book The Elements of User Experience.
In the book, he explains the steps of user experience projects and what UX designers should consider at each stage.
This is where most of my planning process steps came from.

The 5 planes of UX are as below:

- The Strategy Plane
- The Scope Plane
- The Structure Plane
- The Skeleton Plane
- The Surface Plane

## The Strategy Plane
